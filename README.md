# Work Day Scheduler
## This repo is for a simple work day planner.

As stated above, the [Work Day Scheduler](https://nathanjamis.github.io/WorkDayScheduler/) functions with the help of the [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library.
* When the user opens the page, the current time and date are displayed at the top.
* If the current time is between 9am - 5pm, the text areas will display one of the following
    * Grey for the past hours
    * Red for the current hour
    * Green for future hours
* The user can input into the hour block text areas, then click the save button on the right side of the corresponding hour block to save their input to the local storage
## It's that simple!
